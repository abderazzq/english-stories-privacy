Privacy Policy – English Stories
Effective date: 2025-08-14

Languages: English
1) Who we are
“English Stories” is a mobile app that lets you read short stories offline/online. We keep data collection to the minimum required to operate ads and basic app preferences.

2) What we collect
Advertising data (via Google AdMob): the Google Mobile Ads SDK may collect your Advertising ID (AAID), approximate location (derived from IP), device information, and interaction data to serve, cap, and measure ads. We do not receive or store this data on our own servers.
App preferences (on device only): we store basic settings like favorites or last-read story using local storage (SharedPreferences). This stays on your device and is not uploaded to us.
No account, no login, no user-generated content.
3) Why we collect it
To show ads and keep the app free (frequency capping, fraud prevention, measurement).
To remember simple preferences locally (favorites, last screen).
4) Third parties
We use Google AdMob. Please review Google’s policies to learn how data is used:

5) Children’s privacy
We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and believe a child has provided personal data, please contact us and we will address it. Where required, we aim to show only contextual ads to child users.

6) Data retention
We do not keep server-side records. Local preferences remain on your device until you uninstall the app or clear the app’s data. Ad data is handled by Google per its own retention policies.

7) Security
We do not run our own backend. We rely on the security of the operating system, the Google Play ecosystem, and Google’s ad services.

8) Your choices
Reset or limit ad personalization in your device settings (Advertising/Ads).
Manage Google ad personalization at adssettings.google.com.
Clear the app’s data to remove local preferences.
9) Changes to this policy
We may update this policy from time to time. We will update the “Effective date” above.
